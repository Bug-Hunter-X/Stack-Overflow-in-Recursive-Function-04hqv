```hack
function foo(x: int): int {
  if (x == 0) {
    return 1;
  } else {
    return x * foo(x - 1);
  }
}

function main(): void {
  echo foo(5);
}
```
This code will cause a stack overflow error if the input is too large. This is because the function calls itself recursively without a base case that will eventually stop the recursion. The base case should be when x is 0 or less. In this case, it will return 1, and the recursive calls will eventually stop.

Another potential issue is that the function does not handle negative inputs. If the input is negative, the function will call itself recursively infinitely, which will also cause a stack overflow error.
